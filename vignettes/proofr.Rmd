Load `proofr`


```r
library(proofr)
```

## Authenticate with the PROOF API

Run the function `proof_authenticate()`, which calls the PROOF API with your username and password, and returns an API token (an alphanumeric string).


```r
proof_authenticate("username", "password")
#> xyGKibGctQ92rmMKKb39q43XgPxGCmrWoX7NZtamTjDP
```

(note: the above token is not a real token)

The token is not only returned but is set as an environment variable within the R session. This is important as it's not a good security practice to pass secrets such as API tokens as parameters to functions.

That is to say, please do save your API token as an environment variable somewhere on your computer, but you shouldn't need it after running `proof_authenticate()` because we'll look for it as an environment variable.

## Start a Cromwell Server

Start the server


```r
proof_start()
```

Get the URL


```r
metadata <- proof_status()
cromwell_url <- metadata$cromwellUrl
cromwell_url
```

## rcromwell setup

Load  `rcromwell`


```r
if (!requireNamespace("rcromwell", quietly=TRUE)) {
  install.packages("pak")
  pak::pak("rcromwell")
}
library(rcromwell)
library(httr)
```

Set the Cromwell server URL to be recognized by `rcromwell`


```r
cromwell_config(cromwell_url)
```

Set the `Authorization` HTTP header to be used in all `rcromwell` HTTP requests


```r
httr::set_config(proof_header())
```

You should now be able to interact with your Cromwell server with authentication details retrieved via the `proofr` package!

## Interact with the Cromwell server

Now, check the version of your Cromwell server


```r
cromwell_version()
```

## Done!

You're now setup to interact with your Cromwell server. See the `rcromwell` [package docs](https://getwilds.org/rcromwell/) to get started.
